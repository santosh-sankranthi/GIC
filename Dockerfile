# feelc as a Docker rule-engine service. The engine is CGO-free and network-free by default, so the
# image is a single static binary on distroless — no shell, no package manager, minimal surface.

#   docker run --rm -p 8080:8080 -v "$PWD/sample-project:/work" feelc      # serve a project + UI
#
# Mount a project directory (a set of .rules modules + feelc.project.json) at /work. Edits made in the
# UI are persisted back to the mounted volume; --watch hot-reloads external changes.
