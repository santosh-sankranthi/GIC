# and by the manual `publish-npm` recovery job in .github/workflows/npm.yml:

# Auth precedence:
#   1. $NPM_TOKEN set  -> publish with that token (an npm "Automation" token bypasses 2FA). Fatal on
#      failure (a configured publish must succeed).
#   2. $NPM_TOKEN empty -> npm OIDC "trusted publishing" (needs a trusted publisher configured for the
#      `feelc` package against this workflow + `id-token: write`). If it is not configured/matching, npm
#      returns ENEEDAUTH; we surface a loud ::error:: annotation but keep exit 0 so the binary release
#      still goes out — re-run the `publish-npm` workflow once auth is in place to catch npm up.

# therefore resolves to that old npm, which has no OIDC support: it silently skips the token exchange
# and dies with ENEEDAUTH. The release workflow upgrades the GLOBAL npm (`npm install -g npm@latest`),
# which lives next to the `node` binary and is never shadowed by node_modules — prefer it.
